# Standardized-Test-Result-Analysis
An analysis of mock-data for standardized testing across school districts assessing the following KPI/Budgetary measures per district and school: 
*  Average math and reading scores
*  Proportions of students with passing math and reading scores (scores >70)
*  Trends for highest-performing and lowesst-performing schools
*  Scores across grade, school type, size, and spending, were assessed for patterns.

# PyCity Schools Analysis

"In this sample, the performance of Charter school students exceeded that of District school students on all metrics:

Charter school students held higher average standardized testing scores for both math (7 points higher) and reading (3 points higher).
The proportion of Charter school students who passed per subject was higher than that of District school students (roughly 26% higher in math and 14% higher in reading).
The percentage of Charter school students considered overall passing were about 37% more than that of District school students.
Other observations include:

A negative correlation is present where scores decrease as the size of the school increases.
Notably, the higher-end spending range of $645-680 per student holds lower scores than the lower-spending groups. There appears to be no correlation otherwise."
